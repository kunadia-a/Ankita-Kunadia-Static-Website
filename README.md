* Landing page - The landing page is the home page that includes an introduction, a photo, and a navigation bar with navigation to an external LinkedIn page, external Instagram page, internal Contact page, and internal About Me page.

* Navigational elements - The navigation buttons change based on what page you are currently on. For exampple, on the landing page the navigation buttons are for LinkedIn, Instagram, Contact, About Me. On the internal Contact page the navigation buttons are for LinkedIn, Instagram, About Me, and Home (the landing page). On the internal About Me page the navigation buttons are for LinkedIn, Instagram, Contact, and Home (the landing page).

* Internal links opening in the same browser tab - Yes, the Contact and About Me links do this.

* External links opening in new browser tab - Yes, the LinkedIn and Instagram links do this.

* HTML table with CSS styling - I used an HTML table for properly center and format images with text on the landing page, Contact page, and About Me page.

* Animated component - If you hover over the naviagation buttons there is a squiggly line at appears.

* Attention to responsiveness - I tested on Chrome and Firefox on both my PC and iPhone. The issue on my phone was that the image on the landing page did not properly center but otherwise the responsiveness seems alright.
